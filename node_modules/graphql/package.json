It is not a fully\nstandalone GraphQL server that a client developer could use to start\nmanipulating and querying data. Most importantly, it provides no mapping to a\nfunctioning, production-ready backend. The only \"backend\" we have targeted for\nthis early preview are in-memory stubs in test cases.\n\nWe are releasing this now because after GraphQL was first discussed publicly,\nmany engineers used this information to implement the parts of the system that\nwe discussed publicly. We want to support those engineers by providing both a\nformal specification and a reference implementation for the system as a whole.\n\nTo that end, the target audience is not the client developer, but those who have\nbuilt or are actively interested in building their own GraphQL implementations and\ntools. Critically, we also want feedback on the system and to incorporate that\nfeedback in our final release.\n\nIn order to be broadly adopted, GraphQL will have to target a wide\nvariety of backends, frameworks, and languages, which will necessitate a\ncollaborative effort across projects and organizations. This technical preview\nmarks the beginning of that process.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAn overview of GraphQL in general is available in the\n[README](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/blob/master/README.md) for the\n[Specification for GraphQL](https://github.com/facebook/graphql). That overview\ndescribes a simple set of GraphQL examples that exist as [tests](src/__tests__)\nin this repository. A good way to get started with this repository is to walk\nthrough that README and the corresponding tests in parallel.\n\n### Using GraphQL.js\n\nInstall GraphQL.js from npm\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save graphql\n```\n\nGraphQL.js provides two important capabilities: building a type schema, and\nserving queries against that type schema.\n\nFirst, build a GraphQL type schema which maps to your code base.\n\n```js\nimport {\n  graphql,\n  GraphQLSchema,\n  GraphQLObjectType,\n  GraphQLString\n} from 'graphql';\n\nvar schema = new GraphQLSchema({\n  query: new GraphQLObjectType({\n    name: 'RootQueryType',\n    fields: {\n      hello: {\n        type: GraphQLString,\n        resolve() {\n          return 'world';\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  })\n});\n```\n\nThis defines a simple schema with one type and one field, that resolves\nto a fixed value. The `resolve` function can return a value, a promise,\nor an array of promises. A more complex example is included in the top\nlevel [tests](src/__tests__) directory.\n\nThen, serve the result of a query against that type schema.\n\n```js\nvar query = '{ hello }';\n\ngraphql(schema, query).then(result => {\n\n  // Prints\n  // {\n  //   data: { hello: \"world\" }\n  // }\n  console.log(result);\n\n});\n```\n\nThis runs a query fetching the one field defined. The `graphql` function will\nfirst ensure the query is syntactically and semantically valid before executing\nit, reporting errors otherwise.\n\n```js\nvar query = '{ boyhowdy }';\n\ngraphql(schema, query).then(result => {\n\n  // Prints\n  // {\n  //   errors: [\n  //     { message: 'Cannot query field boyhowdy on RootQueryType',\n  //       locations: [ { line: 1, column: 3 } ] }\n  //   ]\n  // }\n  console.log(result);\n\n});\n```\n\n### Want to ride the bleeding edge?\n\nThe `npm` branch in this repository is automatically maintained to be the last\ncommit to `master` to pass all tests, in the same form found on npm. It is\nrecommend to use builds deployed npm for many reasons, but if you want to use\nthe latest not-yet-released version of graphql-js, you can do so by depending\ndirectly on this branch:\n\n```\nnpm install graphql@git://github.com/graphql/graphql-js.git#npm\n```\n\n### Contributing\n\nWe actively welcome pull requests, learn how to\n[contribute](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n### Changelog\n\nChanges are tracked as [Github releases](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/releases).\n\n### License\n\nGraphQL is [BSD-licensed](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/LICENSE).\nWe also provide an additional [patent grant](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/master/PATENTS).\n",
